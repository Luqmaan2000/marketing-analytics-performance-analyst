# 📊 Marketing Funnel & Attribution Analysis (E-Commerce Simulation)

This project simulates and analyzes a multi-touch marketing journey using Python. It explores how users interact with various channels before converting, and applies attribution modeling to understand each channel's contribution to conversion.


## 📊 Project Objectives

- Understand how many touchpoints users have before converting
- Analyze which channels appear early (first-touch) vs. late (last-touch)
- Apply attribution models to measure channel contribution:
  - First-touch
  - Last-touch
  - Linear attribution

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Data Cleaning & EDA**: structuring, grouping, filtering, joining
- **Funnel Analysis**: touchpoint depth, conversion behavior
- **Attribution Modeling**: channel-level contribution scoring
- **Data Visualization**: stacked histograms, bar charts
- **Project Structuring**: modular scripts and reproducible notebooks

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Users who convert typically engage with 2–5 touchpoints
- **Social Media** and **Paid Search** are strong acquisition channels
- **Email** and **Direct** are effective in closing conversions
- Linear attribution reveals that most channels play a role across the funnel

## 📊 Attribution Modeling

The project compares three models:

### 1. First-Touch Attribution
- Credits the **initial channel**
- Emphasizes acquisition performance

### 2. Last-Touch Attribution
- Credits the **final channel**
- Highlights closing/retargeting strength

### 3. Linear Attribution
- Distributes credit **evenly across all touchpoints**
- Best reflects multi-touch journeys
